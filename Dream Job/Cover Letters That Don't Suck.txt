Hello Team,

You’re building a great feedback organization product I think has great potential, you have a small but dedicated team and you are wondering why you should hire me to fill the Full Stack Developer position.

Here’s why:

I have 5+ years experience building software and 3+ years' experience working with frameworks like React, Redux, MongoDB. Okay maybe that’s not enough, everybody seems to have those these days.

I have close to 2 years of startup experience, so I know what it means to wear many hats, still ship code in response to user needs' and changing market situation and all the while still bootstrapping. Still not good enough? Keep reading...

I’ve worked on a number of real world applications used by more than 2 million users so I've dealt with real world performance and scalability issues. If this piques your interest, then maybe this technical summary for a performance optimization I did at Chegg may interest you too.

I hold a masters in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University which speaks to my sound technical knowledge and understanding of core computer science fundamentals. Please tell me you’re willing to consider by now...

If by now, I’ve given you a reason to consider my application and I really hope I have, then kindly go through my resume attached. If not, then just maybe I’m not a good fit for you :).

I hope to hear from you soon.
